                        <p>Local Backhaul Networks is aware of the Bash (Bourne Again SHell) UNIX Shell vulnerability, dubbed “ShellShock”, which is a security concern due to the ability for Bash bypassing environment restrictions in certain environments, 
                            a widely-used opensource *NIX shell. It has been discovered that Bash incorrectly handled trailing code in function definitions. An attacker could use this issue to bypass environment restrictions, such as SSH forced command environments.<br>

                        <p>Local Backhaul Networks is aware of the vulnerability, dubbed “Heartbleed”, which is a security concern for users of OpenSSL, a widely-used opensource cryptographic software library. It can allow attackers to read the memory of the systems using vulnerable versions of OpenSSL library 
                            (1.0.1 through 1.0.1f). This may disclose the secret keys of vulnerable servers, which allows attackers to decrypt and eavesdrop on SSL encrypted communications and impersonate service providers. In addition, other data in memory may be disclosed, which conceivably could include 
                            usernames and passwords of users or other data stored in server memory.<br>
                            All OcularIP and W.O.O.D. Data Centers providing Customer Web Portals do not suffer from the Heartbleed vulnerability as described above. This means all users logging into the OcularIP or W.O.O.D. Customer Web Portals are secured and do not suffer from this identified vulnerability. 
                            We do recommend all users change their passwords following customer's best practice policies.<br><br>
