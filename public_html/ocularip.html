                            As the industry’s leading performance monitoring and SLA assurance portal, OcularIP can provide a competitive advantage to help service providers win business. 
                            And its deployment cost is directly aligned with revenues, so providers can “pay- as-you-go.”

                            <p class="ocularip_destac">OcularIP is a hosted service that lets service providers avoid the cost and complexity of buying, building and maintaining on-premise software and database intensive performance management systems. 
                                Deployment can take a few weeks without a major up front financial commitment.</p>
                            <p id="ocularip_sub_section_12">Because of its customizable features based on an open architecture, OcularIP has more contracted circuits than all other portals combined.<br>
                                OcularIP is architected to integrate into a carrier's infrastructure, leveraging current systems and user credentials while incorporating carrier branding and graphics.<br>
                                This privately hosted and secure web portal simplifies the monitoring of network infrastructures as demanded by wireless operators. Existing subscribers consistently comment about the rich user interface and that OcularIP is so user friendly.<br>
                                Yet it provides detailed granularity and real-time reporting down to the second, all with a user-friendly dashboard view that allows viewers to drill down for necessary detail with the click of a mouse.<br>
                                OcularIP was developed by a team whose experience includes operating service provider networks comprised of optical, carrier Ethernet, off-net and wireless backhaul circuits. The customer base of OcularIP includes companies in the wireless, fiber transport, local access (MSO) provider, and enterprise industries.

                            <p id="ocularip_sub_section_21">The open architecture of OcularIP means it provides statistical analysis utilizing technologies that account for more than 85% of the carrier Ethernet market. 
                                Our multi-vendor support allows operators, most of whom utilize multiple equipment manufacturers, to leverage their existing technology investment without spending additional dollars.<br>
                                OcularIP offers a better solution than network equipment vendors as it is built from the ground up as an SaaS vendor-independent solution. LB Networks is not trying to sell equipment, and unlike test equipment vendors, 
                                OcularIP can leverage multiple sources so operators can use existing equipment with the knowledge that OcularIP can bring the data together.</p>
                            <p class="ocularip_info_subtitle" id="ocularip_sub_section_22_title">Performance Connect™</p>
                            <p id="ocularip_sub_section_22">Performance Connect™, OcularIP’s family of application programming interfaces (API), leverages OcularIP’s extensive data analytics and open architecture to enhance integration into service providers’ OSS/BSS, security and emerging SDN environments. 
                                Performance Connect enables service providers to present a network-as-a-service utility model, for true service and value differentiation.<br>
                                Single-Sign-On Integration (SSO), Dynamic Bandwidth Ordering, and integration with other existing carrier applications and systems (such as provisioning, inventory control and trouble ticketing systems) are among the many features of Performance Connect™.<br>
                                With Single-Sign-On Integration, customers bypass the complexities of dissimilar login and authentication. The SSO API enables the service provider to utilize their current identity management processes (IDM) and access permissions of each customer within OcularIP, 
                                greatly reducing the burden on both the carrier and the customer.<br>
                                <b>Through the Dynamic Bandwidth Ordering API, carrier customers can increase their network bandwidth on-demand, directly through their customer portal.</b><br>
                                The Performance Connect™ APIs enable service providers to seamlessly integrate with SDN and/or SON controllers and offer Representation State (REST) extensibility in addition to supporting future OpenFlow protocols evolving in the SDN ecosystem.</p>
                            <p class="ocularip_info_subtitle" id="ocularip_sub_section_23_title">PBP (Private Branding Plus™)</p>
                            <p id="ocularip_sub_section_23">The ability to custom theme their customer portal is an important tool for carriers in building business. Unlike other web portals that can only offer a simple logo change, OcularIP allows carriers to completely customize the portal with their corporate/brand 
                                identity – themes, graphics, colors and nomenclature – for a compelling customer story.</p>
                            <p class="ocularip_info_subtitle" id="ocularip_sub_section_24_title">Geographic Map View</p>
                            <p id="ocularip_sub_section_24">The Geographic Map view displays circuit hierarchies with support for dynamic and area clustering.<br>
                                The clustering support, exclusive to OcularIP, preserves the flexible organization and grouping of circuits that has long been a popular feature with the existing “tree” navigational hierarchies.</p>
                            <p class="ocularip_info_subtitle" id="ocularip_sub_section_25_title">OcularIP Firsts</p>
                            <p id="ocularip_sub_section_25">OcularIP is the first to release an iPad app for complete portability, opening up instant access to network performance outside the NOC (network operations center). With the OcularIP app, service providers have up-to-the-minute performance reporting at their fingertips, 24–7.<br>
                                It’s the first portal to leverage MEF’s Y1731 and RFC2544 standards.<br>
                                There are a host of other firsts within the OcularIP reporting system. It’s the only portal where a circuit can be in multiple, user defined domains (by customer, CO/headend, offnet and or service type) and the only portal with “point and click” access to build custom screens and dashboards within seconds.<br>
                                OcularIP is the only portal that measures service against multiple service levels –SLAs, Custom Threshold Levels, and historical baseline and/or custom benchmark thresholds. With OcularIP, moderators can define/add user access within their company by profiles, KPIs, analytics, alerts and more.</p>

                            OcularIP’s auto-discovery feature makes it easy for new subscribers who have already deployed hundreds, even thousands of circuits in their network to import them into the database. 
                            The automated provisioning “bot” in OcularIP discovers and provisions the existing circuits in the provider’s network, avoiding hours of manual provisioning often required by other systems.</p>
                            <p class="ocularip_info_subtitle" id="ocularip_sub_section_33_title">Summary</p>
                            <p id="ocularip_sub_section_33">OcularIP enables subscribers to automate the time-consuming preparation of SLA performance validation reports and liberates service providers from the daunting task of building their own reporting infrastructure, 
                            data collection engines, database servers and expensive on-premise management tools.<br>
                            With small cell growth destined to dwarf the macro cell site backhaul transport revenues of recent years, a solution like OcularIP is more important than ever.<br>
                            We have just touched on the myriad reporting and analytical features of OcularIP. There is so much more to tell. No other customer performance portal in the industry can provide all of the benefits of OcularIP.<br>
